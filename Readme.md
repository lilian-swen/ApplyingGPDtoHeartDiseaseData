## Project Overview

In this academic research project, we focused on safeguarding sensitive healthcare data while enabling data analysis for informed decision-making. Our mission was to protect individual patient privacy without compromising the integrity of the statistical information in the data. To achieve this, we applied the Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) algorithm to a heart disease dataset, introducing controlled noise to maintain privacy.



## My Contributions

I played a pivotal role in this project with the following responsibilities:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring dataset accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Processing:** Preparing the data for analysis and privacy protection.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** Identifying suitable machine learning models and training them.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Rigorously assessing model performance for data integrity and privacy protection.

5. **Application of Gaussian Differential Privacy:** Implementing the GDP algorithm to protect individual patient privacy.

   
## Collaboration

This collaborative project also included two other team members who focused on researching the GDP mechanism. They provided comprehensive explanations and coding solutions related to sensitivity principles, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of our privacy protection approach. I haven't included their code here. If you would like to access all the related code implementations, please reach out via the email address.



## Challenge

The accuracy of the machine learning models on the original heart disease dataset was below 50%, it was difficult to meaningfully compare the performance of the models before and after applying Gaussian differential privacy. After performing proper feature engineering, the accuracy of the models has been increased to a level where meaningful comparisons can be made.
